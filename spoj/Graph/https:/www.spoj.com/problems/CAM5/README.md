different approach dfs_using map and unordered_map:- implement using using unordered_map, on spoj it take time 0.44 sec and 22M memory if you will use map then it will go even more worst situation because of insertion and search operation take O(log(n)) time

dfs_using vector<vector > :-
it is better than above approach
